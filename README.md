# MUSIC-WEBPAGE
This repository features a specially curated collection of peaceful and relaxing music tracks, designed to provide a calming atmosphere. Originally developed as part of the CCSA E-book Corner website during my 5th semester of BCA, this webpage has become a personal favorite that I often revisit for its melodious tunes. I am excited to share this project with you and hope you find the music as enjoyable and soothing as I do.
